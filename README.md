# AssessmentTest

Currently I have two files
1. assessmentTest
2. Test
For running the code the main is in the test.java file and this is where changes can be made.

Assumptions
I assumed that for every one customer i would be one singular tab/order. Therfore I did not have a max capacity for this restaurant
I also assumed that the orders from customers would be linear and the amount of time it takes to complete one order versus another does not differ which is not true in an actual restaurant.
